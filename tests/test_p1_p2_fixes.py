"""Fences for six defects that reach a real user.

  B30 heal_links --apply counted a fix that changed nothing, then tripped its
      own no-progress guard and abandoned every remaining safe fix
  B31 a podcast feed controlled the fetch target, so it could reach localhost,
      a dev server, or a cloud metadata endpoint - and the body was then
      summarized by an LLM and written into the vault
  B22 the bytecode cleanup was cwd-relative, so invoking build.sh by absolute
      path (which the vault updater does) shipped .pyc files into the vault
  B18 SKILL.md called the ASCII hyphen an em dash, so an agent following it
      literally produced filenames that no wikilink can resolve
  B33 the documented set_fields example was a silent soft-delete
  B34 one failing case aborted the entire retrieval eval
