"""Platform ownership has to be real, not a governance file nobody reads.

Five audit findings in this repo (B3, B19, B20, S15, S23) were one defect: a
build that compiled cleanly, shipped, and was wrong in a way only a daily user
of that platform would spot. Ownership is the fix, and the thing that makes
someone want to own a build is their name shipping inside it.

So the table in adapters/OWNERS.md is not documentation, it is input to the
build. These tests pin that: every platform appears exactly once, a claimed
platform's credit reaches its INSTALL.md, and an unclaimed one stays clean. If
the table and the builds can disagree, the incentive quietly stops existing.
