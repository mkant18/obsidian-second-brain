"""Adversarial frontmatter inputs for the adapter parser.

Both defects here share a failure shape: the parser produced something
non-empty, so every downstream fallback thought it had a real value and the
build exited 0 with a broken artifact.

  B5 A UTF-8 BOM makes line 1 `﻿---`, which never matches /^---$/. The
     frontmatter fence is therefore never found: `description` falls back to the
     generic "Run the <name> command" string and command_body prints nothing, so
     the platform ships a skill whose instructions are an empty file.

  B6 `description: >` puts only the indicator on the key line, so the parser
     returned a literal ">". Non-empty, so the empty-value fallback never fired,
     and Codex, Antigravity, OpenCode and Hermes all select skills by
     description - making the command permanently unreachable. Not hypothetical:
     adapters/pi/adapter.sh emits a folded description itself.
